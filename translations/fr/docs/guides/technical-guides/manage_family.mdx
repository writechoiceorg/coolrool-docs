title: Manage Family & Relatives
---

Many sports clubs have members who are underage or need a guardian’s assistance in setting up their account—think of parents signing up their children, or older siblings managing rides for younger ones. COOLROOL supports linking relatives so parents, guardians, or other family members can manage these profiles from a single account. This guide will show how to add, view, and update those relationships, making it easy for families to coordinate carpools and event logistics.

## Typical Workflow

## 1. **Add a New Relative**

If a user wants to sign up a child or someone in their family who can’t manage their own app account, they’ll add a relative under their profile. This also works if you’re an adult caretaker registering an elderly family member for a sports activity. For this, you can use the `POST /relatives` endpoint.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.coolrool.com/relatives \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'name=Timmy' \
  --form 'surname=Smith' \
  --form 'phone=+905521234567' \
  --form 'role=Child' \
  --form 'clubs=["1001"]' \
  --form 'img=@/path/to/child-photo.jpg'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": 2001,
  "role": "Child",
  "relativeName": "Timmy",
  "relativeSurname": "Smith",
  "phone": "+905521234567",
  "isConfirmed": false,
  ...
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. **Associating a Relative with a Club**

If your child joins a soccer or dance club, you want them to appear on that club’s roster so they can be invited to events and carpools. This can happen automatically if you included `clubs=["1001"]` when you created them. Otherwise, you can explicitly link them to a new club later. To do this, you can use the [`POST /relatives/track-relative`](/reference/endpoints/relatives-controller-add-relatives) endpoint.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.coolrool.com/relatives/track-relative \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "relativeId": 2001,
    "clubId": 1001
  }'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": "relative-club-link-uuid",
  "user": "...",
  "relative": "...",
  "clubMembership": "...",
  ...
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. **View or Update Relative Details**

Whether you want to see a list of all your children’s accounts or need to correct an email/phone number, COOLROOL offers endpoints to retrieve and modify relative info.

### List All Relatives

The following example shows how to list all relatives for a user using the [`GET /relatives`](/reference/endpoints/relatives-controller-get-relatives) endpoint.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "https://api.coolrool.com/relatives?byPhone=false" \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN>'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
[
  {
    "id": 2001,
    "role": "Child",
    "relativeName": "Timmy",
    "isConfirmed": false,
    "clubs": [ "1001" ]
  },
  {
    "id": 2002,
    "role": "Mother",
    "relativeName": "Sarah",
    "isConfirmed": true,
    ...
  }
]
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Update Relative

The following example shows how to update a relative’s details using the [`PATCH /relatives`](/reference/endpoints/relatives-controller-update-relatives) endpoint.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.coolrool.com/relatives \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'relativeId=2001' \
  --form 'name=Timothy' \
  --form 'surname=Smith' \
  --form 'role=Child' \
  --form 'removePhoto=false' \
  --form 'img=@/path/to/new-child-photo.jpg'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": 2001,
  "role": "Child",
  "relativeName": "Timothy",
  "relativeSurname": "Smith",
  ...
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 4. **Deleting or Unlinking a Relative**

If a child no longer participates in a club or you need to remove a relative’s data entirely, COOLROOL supports both partial (unlink) and complete (delete) removal. In order to delete a relative, you can use the [`DELETE /relatives`](/reference/endpoints/relatives-controller-delete-relatives) endpoint.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.coolrool.com/relatives \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "relativeId": 2001
  }'
```
</TabItem>  
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": 2001,
  "relativeName": "Timothy",
  "deleted": true
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The relative is now removed from the user’s account. If you only want to remove them from a specific club but keep them in your family list, you’d use `/relatives/track-relative` with a DELETE call.
