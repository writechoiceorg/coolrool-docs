title: Manage Sponsors & Advertisements
---

Many sports clubs rely on sponsorships and advertisements to help cover costs and foster partnerships. With COOLROOL, you can manage sponsor records, link them to clubs, and display targeted advertisements or banners in the app. This guide shows how to add sponsors, attach them to clubs, and handle unique images or promotional messages.

## Typical Workflow

<Image src="media/manage-sponsors-flow.svg" alt="Manage Sponsors Flow" />

## 1. **Create a New Sponsor**
A sponsor might be a national sports brand, a local restaurant, or any organization supporting your club. COOLROOL stores sponsor details (name, logo, contact info) so you can later attach them to clubs or events. Use the [`POST /sponsor`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-add-sponsor) endpoint to create a new sponsor record.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.coolrool.com/sponsor \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'name=SuperSports' \
  --form 'description=Leading sports equipment brand' \
  --form 'isGlobal=true' \
  --form 'contactPersonName=John' \
  --form 'contactPersonSurname=Doe' \
  --form 'contactPersonPhone=+330000000' \
  --form 'website=https://www.supersports.com' \
  --form 'img=@/path/to/sponsor-logo.png'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": 3001,
  "name": "SuperSports",
  "photoUrl": "https://cdn.coolrool.com/sponsor-logo-3001.png",
  "description": "Leading sports equipment brand",
  "isGlobal": true,
  "contactPersonName": "John",
  "contactPersonSurname": "Doe",
  ...
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Sponsors marked `isGlobal` can appear in any club, while `isLocal` sponsors might only be relevant to specific regions.

---

## 2. **Add Unique Images or Banners**
Many sponsors want rotating banners or seasonal ads. You can store these images and schedule them for display in the app at certain dates using the [`PATCH /sponsor/unique-images/{id}`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-update-file) endpoint.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url "https://api.coolrool.com/sponsor/unique-images/3001" \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'specialDate=2025-12-01T00:00:00Z' \
  --form 'endSpecialDate=2025-12-31T23:59:59Z' \
  --form 'url=https://cdn.coolrool.com/holiday-sale.jpg' \
  --form 'name=Holiday Sale Banner' \
  --form 'description=20% off all equipment'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": 5002,
  "imageUrl": "https://cdn.coolrool.com/holiday-sale.jpg",
  "specialDate": "2025-12-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endSpecialDate": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "name": "Holiday Sale Banner",
  "description": "20% off all equipment",
  "sponsor": {
    "id": 3001,
    "name": "SuperSports",
    ...
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## 3. **Attach a Sponsor to a Club**
If `SuperSports` is sponsoring `Thunder FC` specifically, you can link them so the club’s members see relevant ads in their app using the [`POST /sponsor/club-sponsor`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-add-club-sponsor) endpoint. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.coolrool.com/sponsor/club-sponsor \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>' \
  --form 'clubId=1001' \
  --form 'sponsorId=3001'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": "club-sponsor-link-uuid",
  "club": {
    "id": 1001,
    "name": "Thunder FC"
  },
  "sponsor": {
    "id": 3001,
    "name": "SuperSports"
  },
  "isActive": true
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this point, members of `Thunder FC` may see `SuperSports` ads or banners in their COOLROOL interface.

## 4. **Displaying Ads in the App**
Once a sponsor is linked, COOLROOL automatically shows sponsor branding in relevant sections—like the event booking flow, the club dashboard, or a user’s news feed. You don’t need to code display logic unless you’re customizing the front-end. You can use the following endpoints to fetch sponsor data:

- [`GET /sponsor/club/{clubId}`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-get-club-sponsor) to fetch all sponsors for a particular club.  
- [`GET /sponsor/recommendation`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-get-recommended-sponsors), [`GET /sponsor/global`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-get-global-sponsors), or [`GET /sponsor/local`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-get-local-sponsors) for more targeted sponsor groupings.

The following example shows how to fetch all sponsors for a particular club:
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.coolrool.com/sponsor/recommendation \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <USER_TOKEN>'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
[
  {
    "id": 3001,
    "name": "SuperSports",
    "photoUrl": "https://cdn.coolrool.com/sponsor-logo-3001.png",
    "description": "Leading sports equipment brand",
    ...
  }
]
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## 5. **Manage or Remove a Sponsor**
If a sponsor contract expires or they no longer wish to appear, you can update or delete their record using the following endpoints:

- [`PATCH /sponsor/{sponsorId}`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-update-sponsor) – Update sponsor details (e.g., name, contact info, or add/remove clubs).  
- [`DELETE /sponsor/{sponsorId}`](/reference/endpoints/sponsor-controller-delete-sponsor) – Remove the sponsor from COOLROOL entirely.

The following example shows how to delete a sponsor:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Request">
```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url "https://api.coolrool.com/sponsor/3001" \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>'
```
</TabItem>  
<TabItem value="Response">
```json
{
  "id": 3001,
  "deleted": true
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Clubs previously linked to this sponsor will no longer display their ads.
